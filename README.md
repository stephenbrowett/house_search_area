# house_search_area

This project is designed to highlight an appropriate region for 1 or more people to reach given a dict describing how long they're prepared to travel for.

For example:
- finding the region where 2 or more people could live and both still commute to their jobs,
- finding the region in which a new business could open its offices which is close to the founders,
- narrowing down the region where a group of friends could go for a holiday,
and much more!
